Presenting users by different settings of pictures, analyzing users' description 

(1). Use word_embedding to find words tend to appear in the same context

(2). According to different study design, use multilabel logistics (L2 regularization) and vanilla logistic regression (L1 and L2 regularization) to analyze which words are more important 

(3). Use bag-of-words representations to find words which are dominant in each category. Perform simple logistics regression with L1 loss
